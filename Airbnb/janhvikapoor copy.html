                    <br/><p>My most cherished childhood memories are of spending summers with my family at our coastal oasis
                        in Chennai, India. This home has always felt like a sanctuary, and I want to share that same
                        feeling with my fans. Which is why for the first time ever, I’m opening our home up to a few
                        guests to have the full Kapoor family experience. That means a lot of relaxing—eating South
                        Indian food, doing yoga, and trying my mother’s natural skin care recipes. I can’t wait to share
                        it all with you.</p><br/>

                        <div id="showmore"><span><u>Show more</u></span><i class="fa-solid fa-angle-right"></i></div>

                    <p><b>What you’ll do</b></p>

                    <p>This home in Chennai holds a special place in my heart as I spent many of my childhood summers
                        here with my dear family. Up until now, it’s been sort of our little coastal secret. You see the
                        estate has never even been in pictures, so if you come, you’ll be one of the first guests to not
                        only look upon it, but also stay here. </p><br/>

                    <p>The home rests on four peaceful acres, and you’ll feel a sense of calm the moment you step
                        inside. I’ll be here to greet you, and take you on a private tour of all my favourite details
                        and the memories attached to each one—from the giant, hand-crafted lotus sculpture that welcomes
                        you at the entrance, to all the bespoke furniture made by local artisans featuring Indian
                        rattan, cane, and wood from the region. These materials bring a natural warmth and comfort,
                        which is really important to me when coming from bustling Bollywood to the coast. All of that,
                        and the minimalism of the home and its subtle colour schemes always takes me into zen mode.</p><br/>

                    <p>Perhaps most personal to me is how this home honors my mum’s memory throughout. Portraits of her
                        adorn the walls, and my favourite, one of her own paintings displayed in the dining area. If
                        you’re already a fan of hers, these paintings will give you a new dimension to why we all loved
                        her not just as an actress, but as a mother and artist.</p><br/>

                    <p> spend most of my time in the outdoor areas, including the pool, and the deck where I do yoga,
                        and watch the sun set over the ocean. It’s truly a place meant to be enjoyed with loved ones,
                        and I’m so happy you can now enjoy it with me and your own loved ones.</p><br/>

                    <p>I can’t wait to share this self-care getaway with you.</p><br/>

                    <p>• I’ll take you on a private tour of our coastal home as I reminisce on summers spent with my
                        family.</p><br/>
                    <p>• We’ll enjoy some much deserved relaxation as I show you my all-natural skincare routine that I
                        learned from my mum (hello homemade honey face mask and oils made from hibiscus flower). Who
                        knows, I might just spill my top Bollywood beauty secrets.</p><br/>

                    <p>• You’ll enjoy a wonderful dinner of some of my favourite South Indian dishes like Ghee Podi
                        Rice, Andhra Biryani, Pesarattu Dosa, and Palkova. My mouth is watering thinking about it.</p><br/>

                    <p>• Enjoy a morning yoga session followed by a healthy breakfast (I like to start my day with
                        lassi) and take in ocean views from the deck.</p><br/><br/>
